# Digital Exhibition Faith

A browser-based 3D interactive experience for [Skin Deep magazine](https://skindeepmag.com), built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

The visitor navigates a dimly lit liminal space, acting as a digital art exhibition, as a glowing orb, discovering floating geometric objects. Approaching and interacting with each object will trigger individual exhibition pieces

## How to deploy

This repo is set up for **Cloudflare static hosting with GitHub integration** — once linked, every push to `main` goes live automatically. No build step is required; the project is plain static files.

The experience is intended to be **embedded as an `<iframe>`** on the Skin Deep site:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://your-subdomain.skindeepmag.com"
  style="width:100%; height:100vh; border:none;"
  allow="fullscreen"
></iframe>
```

## Repository structure

```
public/               — the web root served by Cloudflare Pages (the deployed site)
  index.html          — markup + CSS; loads three.min.js then js/main.js (ES module)
  three.min.js        — Three.js r128
  js/                 — main.js (manifest), core.js (shared runtime), exhibits/
  images/             — exhibition photo assets
  orb_tex.webp        — Player orb texture
  tile.webp           — Floor and wall tile texture

optimize_textures.py  — dev-only texture compression script (not deployed)
orb_tex.png / tile.png — source textures for re-optimising (not deployed)
```

The app is buildless ES modules — no bundler, no package manager, no compile step.
Everything that ships lives under `public/`; the browser loads the modules directly.

## Running locally

1. Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   ```
   python -m http.server 8080 --directory public
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser.
3. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

> The page must be served over HTTP (not opened as a `file://` URL) because textures and modules are loaded as separate files.
